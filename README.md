Automating your home, the french way. Balekuy-style.  

My Configuration running on a RPi3 with Raspbian + Home Assistant (pip install) :
- LIFX Lights (2)
- Harmony Hub (to control Philips TV and more)
- DENON AVR X2200w
- Chromecast
- Plex server
- $15 MultiSensor by Bruh Automation (thanks man!)

Todo :


- Add NAS info to HA
- Voice recognition via Google
- Add more multisensors

+ https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/heavyha

Done :

- Configuration of People Presence to activate automations => Best = Owntracks + MQTT / 2nd = DD-WRT + MAC Phone
- Moved from HassIO to Raspbian+HA
- Running MQTT Server on NAS

Peace.
