Automating your home, the french way. Balekuy-style.  

My Configuration running on a RPi3 with HassIO :
- LIFX Lights, Harmony Hub, DENON AVR, Chromecast, Plex, $15 MultiSensor by Bruh Automation (thanks man!)

Todo :
- Voice recognition via Google
- Add second Multisensor (hallway)
- Add third Multisensor (bathroom)

Peace.
