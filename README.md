Automating your home, the french way. Balekuy-style.  

My Configuration running on a RPi3 with HassIO :
- LIFX Lights (2)
- Harmony Hub (to control Philips TV and more)
- DENON AVR X2200w
- Chromecast
- Plex server
- $15 MultiSensor by Bruh Automation (thanks man!)

Todo :
- Migrate from HassIO to Raspbian+HA
- Create MQTT Server on NAS
- Add NAS info to HA
- Configuration of People Presence to activate automations
- Voice recognition via Google
- Add second Multisensor (hallway)
- Add third Multisensor (bathroom)

Peace.
